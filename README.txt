Design Process:
Making a Controller with PG inital the plan is to have a controller for Minecraft
with the P as on the right hand controller and the G in the left hand, 
The P will act as the pickaxe with a analog stick to move, LED that lights up when 
it hits an object in game, audio electronic when it does hit an object. 
With motion detection that empowers the LED and audio cue to occur.
On the left hand contorller the G, this controller will have one a stick for looking
and 4 buttons to inidcate the ABXY.

I thought of the P as the pickaxe as the lower part of the P can be used as
a handle while for the G the curve can be used to hold on horizontally. The buttons on the 
G can be used for player actions whie the main component of the P controller is to 
hit objects.

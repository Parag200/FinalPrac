Design Process:
Making a Controller with PG inital the plan is to have a controller for Minecraft
with the P as on the right hand controller and the G in the left hand, 
The P will act as the pickaxe with a analog stick to move, LED that lights up when 
it hits an object in game, audio electronic when it does hit an object. 
With motion detection that empowers the LED and audio cue to occur.
On the left hand contorller the G, this controller will have one a stick for looking
and 4 buttons to inidcate the ABXY.

I thought of the P as the pickaxe as the lower part of the P can be used as
a handle while for the G the curve can be used to hold on horizontally. The buttons on the 
G can be used for player actions whie the main component of the P controller is to 
hit objects. 



Wowki Set up:
The first step was getting all electronic components being the 2 joysticks,
1 LED, 1 Speaker/buzzer, 4 buttons, 1 Resistor and 1 motion detector.
The electronics were all placed onto the bread board expect the 
joysticks, buzzer and motion detector since these compoentes would be away from the rest of the 
crowded components within the controller. 

CAD Set up:
(P controller)
The first step was creating the P using the sktetch tool to draw out the P
and using the same tool to cut out the hole in the middle of the letter.
The next step was creating a lid and the holes for where the joystick, LED,
and buzzer would go. This was done by shelling the top and lid part of the P controller.
The next step is creating cylinders for our screws to hold the controller togther.
Now that we have the top and bottom part i used the sketch tool to create mulitple cirlces on the controller to locate the screws. 
The location of each scerw corelates to how the cases should be held to ensure no flimsy casing is lose.
The screws length extrude a little inside the controller on the top side of P lid as it allows ensurr casing and
allows the player grip to not be disturbed when holding. The next phase is to create the screws for these holdings.
to do this we go in sketch mode to look at the contorller from above and create a smaller hole from the screw holes, 
then we can extrude and create the screw after threading the screw holding and the screw that phase is complete.
For the next phase we create the holes for the 3 electornic components the 1 joystick, the 1 led and the 1 motion detector. since the player is 
holding the P from the bottom the joystick will be around that area for their thumb, the motion detector and LED will be near the top of the P as the motion detector can 
detector the swing motion best from the apex while the LED pin being at the top makes the player see the best rather than the bottom. 
For the sercuring the parts each part as a case with gaps for the wires, their wires will wrap around the cases n when put inside the casing it won't move. 
The hole at the bottom of the P inidcates the wires coming out towards the ardiuno that will be outside of both controllers. The reason why the ariduno is outside 
is because if it was in one of the controllers the other controller would have to connect to it causing more wiring issues and less freeablility when playing.
